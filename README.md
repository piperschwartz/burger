# burger

In this assignment, I created a burger app that should be able to add a new burger, devour it, and update it. I also tried to add a delete option.

I used handlebars, mysql, express, css, etc.

The database is working, and the connection is listening to the server port. 

There is some tweaking to do to get this to a fully functioning app.
